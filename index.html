      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        PDA Simulator is a visual, animated simulator for pushdown automata,
        created using Java and JavaFX. It allows you to construct pushdown
        automata and simulate their execution on any input string. As there are
        various defintions of pushdown automata used in literature, PDA
        Simulator offers support for multiple definitions, making it likely that
        it can model the definition(s) you are familiar with. However, it is
        important to note that the differences are only superficial; all
        defintions are equally expressive (they can recognise all context-free
        languages). The simulator elaborates on this in the help menu.
      </p>
      <p>Here is a list of the features of PDA Simulator:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lets you create, edit, save and load existing pushdown automata (and
          optionally any notes)
        </li>
        <li>
          Displays both a transition table and diagram view at the same time,
          both of which can be used to edit the PDA
        </li>
        <li>
          Lets you move multiple states simultaneously by highlighting an area
          that contains all states and then moving any of those states
        </li>
        <li>
          Automatically handles the positioning of the transition arrows and
          their labels as you move the states around to prevent overlapping of
          labels
        </li>
        <li>
          Lets you switch between different pushdown automata definitions at any
          time without having to start over
        </li>
        <li>
          Lets you undo and redo successive changes (including moving of PDA
          states)
        </li>
        <li>
          Shows you whether the PDA you are working on is deterministic or not
          as you edit it
        </li>
        <li>Lets you highlight all transitions that cause nondeterminism</li>

        <li>
          Can simulate automaton execution on inputs in 3 different modes,
          step-by-step mode, animation mode and quick-run mode:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Step-by-step mode allows you to manually step through a
              computation and presents all choices if there is nondeterminism,
              so you can advance whichever computation(s) you are interested in
            </li>
            <li>
              Animation mode allows you to watch the automaton execution
              step-by-step automatically, and control the speed of the animation
            </li>
            <li>
              Quick-run mode allows you to see instantly how many (if any)
              accepting computations can be found within a certain step limit,
              and to increase the step limit and try again if no accepting
              computations were found within the step limit
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Contains a comprehensive help menu that explains how to use the
          simulator
        </li>
        <li>
          Contains 5 sample PDAs with some notes for you to experiment with
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Installation instructions</h2>
      <a href="/PDA-Simulator.jar" download>Download PDA Simulator</a>
      <p>
        PDA Simulator can be downloaded using the link above. In order to run
        the executable JAR file, you will need to have JRE/JDK version 8 (or a
        later version) installed on your computer. You can download the latest
        version from the
        <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/"
          >official Oracle website</a
        >. The JAR file already includes the necessary JavaFX runtime libraries,
        so there's no need to install JavaFX separately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have installed Java on your computer, simply double-click the
        downloaded JAR file to run it.
